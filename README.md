# Team up with engineers

*To understand the dev, one must become the dev.*

Create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.

# Be a digital nomad badass
*or at least fake it till you make it*

Plan with [GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

Hang out in [chatrooms](https://gitter.im).

Demand continuous deployment from engineers. Use [feature branches](https://github.com/caalberts/scrabble/pull/29).

# Always be shipping

Use [Codepen](http://codepen.io) to hack up quick code prototypes

Deploy to [Surge](http://surge.sh)
